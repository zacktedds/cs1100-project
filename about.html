                <p class="section-text">Currently, I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Georgia studying Mass Media Arts. The program focuses on video production and media content creation, as well as the related skills and techniques required. I'm also taking courses in Italian and the New Media Institute &mdash; a certificate program within Grady College dedicated to researching new technologies and finding interesting and innovative ways to implement them.</p>
                <p class="section-text">After I graduate, I'd like to work for a movie/television production company in some production aspect, though I wouldn't eliminate the possibility of developing apps in some way in the future. After diving deep into Apple's Swift programming language, I've found it much simpler and easier to understand than previous languages I've tackled.</p>
